I have attached a research paper where I used common Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest to predict the power load of the Dallas Forth Worth Metroplex from 2016-2021. I was able to predict this power load with a 6% margin of error using temperature and population as independent variables. 

I have also provided the code that was used to clean and process the raw data used for this machine learning project.
